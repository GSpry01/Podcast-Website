    <h3>Podcasting for Fun</h3>  
    <p>Ira Glass,National Public Radio persoinality and host/ producer of 'This American Life', said "In radio, you have two tools. Sound and silence.
    That is the basis of podcasting as well, it is journey you go on through sounds and silence. It doesnet matter if that journey is solving a mystery, learning about finances, or even a ghost story. We experience these stories through sounds and silence.
    Podcasting is projected to be an almost 95 billion dollar marrket by 2028 (according to researchandmarkets.com), so while it may be a newer medium than most, it is here to stay. 
    To see where podcasting is going we must understand its history.</p>
